  <h1><b>Shardplates</b></h1>
  <h3>Available in the <b>Fourth Ideal</b></h3>
  <h3>General Characteristics</h3>
  <p>A set of Shardplate is constructed of individual pieces that, when assembled, protect the entire body. There are no gaps between sections of the armor, only increasingly small overlapping Plates. Shardplate helms have visors with eye slits that may be lifted up to expose the face. Although similar in appearance, each individual suit of Shardplate has a unique look, and because it conforms to the shape of its wearer, the same suit may appear unique on different individuals. Suits of Shardplate can weigh over 100 stoneweights.</p>
  <p>Shardplate does not dent or bend. Instead, sections of the armor can crack after heavy or repeated impact and will eventually fail. When a section of the armor fails, it will explode into bits of molten metal. Damaged sections will leak Stormlight. While enough leaks will deplete the gemstones and cause the armor to lock up, individual leaks, even large ones, will eventually "seal over" on their own, preventing further loss of Stormlight, even if the damage hasn't fully healed yet.</p>
  <p>The Shardplate helmet has a face shield with a horizontal eye slit for visibility. In some instances, the face shield can adapt to protect the wearer's vision from the brightness of a lightning strike. It is implied that when closed, the edges of the visor meld into a single, unbroken surface with the rest of the helm in a small puff of mist.</p>
  <p>Shardplate also greatly enhances its users' strength and speed. It provides the ability to jump great distances, heave objects of great weight, and run at high speeds. The extra support of Shardplate can assist the wearer in overcoming physical injuries that might otherwise leave them incapacitated. Shardbearers require extensive training to be able to control this strength and move smoothly without damaging everyday objects. Agility and dexterity are increased by Shardplate. A person armored in Shardplate acquires faster reflexes and is more responsive in battle. Shardplate urges those who wear it to move and take action.</p>
  <h3>Protection</h3>
  <p>Shardplate provides protection from impact caused by a weapon or from a fall. The individual wearing the Plate is able to feel impacts from within the armor, but their force is greatly reduced. The sensation of touch, however, is transferred through the fingers of the gauntlets, allowing the wearer to feel fine detail. Shardplate is durable enough to withstand gunshots. Shardplate is also highly conductive and transmits electricity like a Faraday cage -- allowing electricity to flow through the plate and not the body -- protecting the wearer from attacks by stormform Regals. Shardplates are very heavy and thus it is hard to trip or stumble the Shardbearer.</p>
  <p>Shardplate differs from ordinary armor in that it can stop blows from Shardblades or other highly Invested attacks- This capacity is not unlimited, as damage can still crack and even break the Plate with repeated blows. But Shardplate is one of the few materials that can block or resist a Shardblade strike to any degree, apart from another Shardblade or a half-shard. Shardplate is also designed to maintain temperature and life support, and is strong enough to protect a user from heat that could burn a person alive in seconds.</p>
  <p>Due to its heavily Invested nature, Shardplate protects the user from most forms of Investiture, including Surgebinding, though this effect is weakened if parts, such as the helm, have been removed. It is not possible to use any lashings against someone armored in Shardplate. It is also not possible for a wielder of an Honorblade to Surgebind while wearing Plate, due to interference from the gemstones. The helmet also protects the wearer from emotional Allomancy.</p>
  <h3>Vulnerability</h3>
  <p>Although incredibly strong, Shardplate is not invincible. Repeated impacts to the same areas can cause that piece of the armor to crack and leak Stormlight, depleting it at a higher rate. Once the Stormlight is exhausted, the armor will "freeze up" and be rendered immobile.</p>
  <p>Individual sections of Plate can be cracked to the point of failure. Upon failure, the piece of armor explodes into bits of molten metal, leaving that area of the warrior exposed. A Shardbearer can remain in combat with some pieces of armor missing, but, for example, destroying a greave can incapacitate a Shardbearer by rendering them unable to support the armor's weight. Also, the breastplate is a central support structure for Shardplate; destroying the breastplate alone will cause the armor to stop functioning fully, making it difficult to move the limbs. It is possible to stand up from the ground with a broken breastplate, but the maneuver requires some experience with Plate.</p>
  <p>In close combat, the single most vulnerable spot on Plate is the eye slit. With luck or skill, or by somehow restraining the Shardbearer, a knife, arrow, or spear can be stabbed through the slit; at that specific spot, many wounds will be instantly fatal. When charging against arrows, Shardbearers usually cover their eye slit with their arms to prevent lucky hits.</p>
  <p>There are also a number of tactics that can be used by prepared enemies against Shardplate. The armor is incredibly heavy; though it will protect the wearer from a fall, the fall can still damage the Plate. One tactic used against Shardbearers is to force them to fall a great distance, either by directly pushing them over an edge or by putting them in a position where their great weight, or perhaps some other mechanism, will cause whatever they're walking on to fall apart, dropping the Shardbearer.</p>
  <p>Another common tactic is to bind the Shardbearer with hooks or ropes. Though a Shardbearer's strength is enhanced, enough people holding them back with hooks or ropes can slow them down enough for blows to be struck; ropes can also be strung horizontally to attempt to trip the Shardbearer.</p>
  <p>Massive, blunt projectiles can also be used against Shardplate.</p>
  <p>Bladed or pointed weapons (arrows, spears, swords) typically don't carry enough force to damage Plate, but if Plate is already cracked and an edge catches it, the blow can widen the crack. It's conceivable that a Shardbearer, used to ignoring spear strikes that would normally barely scratch their paint, might be unprepared to respond to an effective use of this weakness.</p>
