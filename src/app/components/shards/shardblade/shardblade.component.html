  <h1><b>Shardblades</b></h1>
  <h3>Available in the <b>Third Ideal</b></h3>
  <h3>General Characteristics</h3>
  <p>While there are a few differences between the various types of Shardblades, they all share a few common traits. All are larger but lighter than any normal sword, often at or approaching six feet in length, while simultaneously extremely light. All Shardblades that are bound to a specific owner can be summoned and dismissed at will. When summoned, they appear in one's hand, coalescing out of mist, with the shape the mist takes depending on the type of spren from which it was formed. Additionally, water condenses along the length of the Blade when it appears. When a Blade is dismissed it also vanishes into mist. They are a alloy of the God Metals of Honor and Cultivation. Each blade has a different ratio of that alloy depending on which radiant spren it is. The tensile strength of Shardblades is very high; while they can bend a small amount, Shardblades appear to be unbreakable under natural circumstances. Shardblades are said to have a sort of magnetism to them, anyone who sees one is drawn to it.</p>
  <p>Shardblades can cut through non-living objects, such as wood or stone, as if they are passing through water. Even though they can cut through nearly any material, there is still a slight bit of resistance even when cutting through inanimate objects. When cutting through an object, Shardblades leave behind distinctive perfectly clean cuts. However, when swung at a person or other living object, the edge of the Shardblade will fuzz, leaving the physical body unharmed, and cutting the being's soul. It is still possible to Soulcast a person killed by a Shardblade. The wielder of the Blade feels a small tug of resistance as the Blade passes through living material. If the Blade cuts the core of a person's limb, the person feels a flash of incredible pain and then the limb turns gray and becomes limp and numb. If an internal organ is pierced by a Shardblade, it may be killed or cease to function. If the Blade strikes the spine or head, the eyes of the person blacken and burn out with a dark smoke rising from them. When a person is killed this way by a Shardblade, death is not instantaneous; it often takes a few moments for the person to be completely dead. Once a person or other living thing has been killed, its remains can be cut like any other inanimate object. This applies to plants as well; it takes two swings of a Shardblade to sever a plant, one to kill the soul and another to cut it. Non-living portions of a living thing, such as hair or nails can be cut with a Shardblade before the creature itself is killed. Parts of a body that have been damaged by a Shardblade are typically referred to as Blade-dead. Blood continues to flow through them, and they do not rot.</p>
  <p>Shardblades cannot be blocked by any typical weapons or armor, but they can be halted by a few things. One Shardblade can block another Shardblade, and when the two collide they may produce sparks. Shardplate can also stop a Shardblade, although two blows to a section of Shardplate is typically enough to shatter it. The half-shards of Jah Keved were also designed by more modern artifabrians to be resistant to Shardblades. These are shields with an Augmenter attached, allowing them to withstand two blows from a Shardblade before breaking. Other highly Invested objects, such as a fully charged metalmind, would be enough to block, or at least resist, a blow from a Shardblade. A heavily Invested person can theoretically resist a blow from a Shardblade. The final known way to block a Shardblade is with aluminum, which is a rare material on Roshar as it can only be obtained through Soulcasting. It is worth noting that the aluminum only nullifies the supernatural sharpness of the Blade, so a thin sheet of aluminum foil would be sheared through easily by a Blade.</p>
